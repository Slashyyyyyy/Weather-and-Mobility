Include, how data has to be stored in extra files

This is the code to my Bachelors Thesis

Order of loading the code for understanding the analysis:

(0. Train_Scrapper -> Not needed, as scrapped data is in Datafile)
1. Train_preprocessing -> Make Data workable
2. Train_GTFS -> Include GTFS into data set
3. Train_Analysis -> First dive into the data
4. Weather_Preprocessing -> Concat different years
5. Weather_Analysis -> Getting a feeling of the weather data
6. Gemeinde-RR -> Creates Dictionary for Rain and Municipalities
7. Train_Weather_Preprocessing -> Connects Rain dictionary with train data
8. Train_Weather_Analysis -> Statistical Analysis of Correlation
9. Unused Code: Weather_warning (API for downloading weather warnings), ERA_Analysis (Early Analysis of the ERA dataset)

The maps can be accessed via the Maps branch
