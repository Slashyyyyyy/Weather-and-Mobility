# Weather-and-Mobility

This is the code to my Bachelors Thesis

It is structured in different parts as sorted in the different branches:  
Train, Weather, Train_Weather, Additional (not-used) Code, Maps

Order of loading the code for understanding the analysis:

0. Train_Scrapper -> Scrappes the Data 
1. Train_preprocessing -> Make Data workable
2. Train_GTFS -> Enrich Data with GTFS
3. Train_Analysis -> First dive into the data
4. Weather_Preprocessing -> Concat different years
5. Weather_Analysis -> Getting a feeling of the weather data
6. Gemeinde-RR -> Creates Dictionary for Rain and Municipalities
7. Train_Weather_Preprocessing -> Connects Rain dictionary with train data
8. Train_Weather_Analysis -> Statistical Analysis of Correlation
9. Unused Code: Weather_warning (API for downloading weather warnings), ERA_Analysis (Early Analysis of the ERA dataset)

If the Data is needed, please write me! :)
